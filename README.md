# Industry Dynamics Simulation

This model simulates the evolution of an industry over time as firms enter, compete, grow, and exit. At the heart of the model is a production function that allows for interdependency (K) between a finite and discrete set of productive activities (N). As N and K increase, the production function becomes complex thus prohibiting analytical optimization and necessitating the search for favorable onfigurations of productive activities that increase firm profits. The profit function, itself, becomes non-linear and resembles a rugged landscape with numerous maxima.

The model configurations below refer to the nature of market competition simulated. For example, the Cournot Model simulates a market where firms create commodity products undifferentiated in quality or type and where firms compete based solely on cost. The Vertical Differentiation Model allows firms to differentiate based on quality but not type, resulting in firms varying their prices with their quality levels. Look for additional market models as they are developed.
